                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        I love everything surrounding the medium of video games. 
                        I enjoy playing/trying new games, reviewing/analyzing games, and even designing/developing games.
                        Some personal favorites of mine include Hollow Knight, Mario Kart, and Elden Ring. Here's a screenshot
                        from a game I created in one of my classes.

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been practicing a few instruments in the past few years, those being saxophone, electric bass, and piano.
                        I enjoy listening music and trying to play instrumentals that I love. I'm also a member of RIT's GSO as an alto saxophone player.
                        Here's a photo from our Spring 2023 concert.

                    <h3>Cooking</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been cooking since high school, and since then I've found some of my favorite dishes to make.
                        I love to make smash burgers, enchiladas, stuffed pobalanos, and various pasta dishes.

                    <p>
                        I've loved sports for all my life, whether it be playing or watching. 
                        I've played many sports in my life, but recently I've been playing basketball, volleyball, and golf. I also enjoy skiing/snowboarding.
                        I most actively follow baseball, as I love the game and the stats assosiated with it, but I've also been watching hockey recently.
                        I recently traveled to Toronto with my girlfriend to see a Maple Leafs game and a Raptors game.

                    <p>
                        I've always loved learning, and learning to code during my degree has been a rewarding experience.
                        Between personal projects, school, and previous work, I've been learning a wide variety of concepts.
                        I've wrote the entire front-end for this website, and I've set-up the host server using Apache.
                        Despite its frustrations, I enjoy the satisfaction of problem solving through code.
                        You can read more about my coding experience on my projects page and on my resume.
