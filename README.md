# website-for-triston
A personal/professional website for myself (Triston)

## Requirements
- A good browser (preferably not IE)

## Ideas/Concepts

### Language Usage
This website is going to start out using just HTML and CSS. 
Once the website is presentable and the vast majority of the pages are setup,
I plan to use angular, a typescript framework, to add extra interactivity/style

### Contents
Planning to include 3 main pages, those being...

- ##### Home: The landing page
- ##### Interests: A page that leads to subpages which go into some detail about my interests/hobbies...
  - ###### Games:  A page including short blurbs/pictures of some of my favorite recent games.
                   Group games by genre?
  - ###### Sports: Basking ball and Volling ball. Statistical analysis of baseball (embed FB video?)
  - ###### Music:  Saxophone and Frank Ocean and stuff
- ##### Resume: pdf viewer of my resume
